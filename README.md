# grunt-encode-images [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jreading/grunt-encode-images.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jreading/grunt-encode-images)

A grunt task for base64 encoding images in css

This task converts all image paths in css files with base64 encoded data-uri formatted strings.


## How to Use

Install this plugin with the command:

```js
npm install grunt-encode-images
```

Add the task to your gruntFile.js:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-encode-images");
```
Example:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
 	encodeImages: {
        build: {
            files: [{
                expand: true,
                cwd: 'build/css/',
                src: '**/phone.min.css',
                dest: 'build/css/'
            }]
        }
    }
});
```

Options:

`flagged: exclude|include` will include or exclude a file from encoding. 
Add target to image path: `url('images/file.png#flagged');`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
 	encodeImages: {
 		options: {
 			flagged: 'exclude'
 		},
        build: {
            files: [{
                expand: true,
                cwd: 'build/css/',
                src: '**/phone.min.css',
                dest: 'build/css/'
            }]
        }
    }
});
```
